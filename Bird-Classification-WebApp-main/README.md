# Bird-Classification-WebApp
A personal project incorporating web development and deep learning. It can classify 41 species of birds in Singapore to some degree of accuracy.
The product webapp is deployed using Flask on the local server, and the model is trained using TensorFlow.
As a beginner TensorFlow and web developer, the syntax and methodologies used are basic.
### Note: The model is not uploaded into this repo due to its large size
### Further Note: This is also uploaded in my other GitHub account
