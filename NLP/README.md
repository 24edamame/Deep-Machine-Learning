# Natural Language Processing
- I experimented with the SkimLit dataset using **Recurrent Neural Networks**, data **embedding** and **tokenisation**.
- I then went on to use other NLP techniques like **Tf-Idf vectorization** and **Stemming** to explore a **Fake News** dataset on Kaggle with ML models like **Random Forest** and **Support Vector Machines**.
